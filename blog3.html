        <i>Ah yes, <b>Video Games</b></i>: a form of entertainment that is frequently frowned upon by our nagging parents, teachers, and the rest of society. One may assume that playing video games is a waste of time and “<i>rots your brain</i>,” but to me, video games are one of my lifestyles. I remember back when I was younger, my father would play this sniper game and he would get so into it. I would just sit there <b>for hours</b> watching him play that and would pretend that I'm the player, pretending to be a sniper. </p>

      <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-bottom: 15px">
        Video games are an integral part of my childhood and is one of the components that have definitely shaped me into who I am today. Growing up playing all types of games, I always wondered about the process behind the creation of games. In fact, when looking over the possible majors I would enroll in, I had the idea of becoming a video game developer. When looking into it, I realize <u>it deals alot with problem solving</u> which I love. Maybe it’s the euphoria of success after solving the problem. Maybe it’s the logical yet also creative aspect of problem solving. Whatever the reason may be, <u>I love problem solving</u>.

        The commom misconception relating to video games is that they're seen as 'unsophisticated' or 'just for lazy people', which I hate to hear, but did you know that many common elements of these simulated worlds can provide tangible benefits in real life? To name a few, these are some benefits that both adults and kids gain from video games:
      </p>

      <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-bottom: 15px">
        Video games play has been linked to <u>increased brain connections and gray matter</u>, according to studies. Gray matter is related to vision, memory, spatial navigation, and muscular control.
      </p>

      <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-bottom: 15px">
        As mentioned earlier, <u>it boosts problem-solving skills</u>. Multi-level, open-world, and mission-based games are intended to be solved over the course of several hours and sometimes, the answer changes depending on how you play the game. The ability to strategize and think quickly under pressure in a fast-paced fantasy setting may be used in real life.
      </p>

      <p class = "opening_text">
        Plus, video games can improve your mood, which also ties into <u>reducing stress levels</u>, which is why video games have been employed in treatment for more than ten years.
      </p>

  <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px">
    Even while playing video games has advantages, doing it for a lengthy period of time is quite harmful. There are the typical <i>clichés</i> like "<i>it may become an addiction</i>" or "<i>it might injure your eyes.</i>", but there's more than that.
  </p>

  <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px">
    <ol style = "padding-left:40px">

      <li style = "font-size: 25px; text-decoration: underline">Suppression of emotions</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever we experience any negative emotions like fear, worry, or shame, the amygdala becomes active. You might wonder, "<i>what's an amygdala?</i>" well, <b>it's the part of that brain that governs negative emotions such as fear, worry, and shame</b>. When we start to play video games when our amygdala is active, <u>it calms down</u>. Two things happen as a result of this:</li>
            <ul style = "padding-left:20px">
              <li style = "padding-bottom: 10px">Constantly repressing unpleasant feelings might make it difficult for a person to <u>recognize their own emotional state</u> and to <u>identify the emotions they are experiencing</u>.</li>
              <li>The amygdala is a core part of our learning circuitry. Painful experiences gets imprinted onto our memory, and we learn from them. If the amygdala is suppressed, <u>we can’t learn from the painful experiences of not doing well in school or at work</u>, which just makes it more challenging for individuals to stop playing video games. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <br>

      <li style = "font-size: 25px; text-decoration: underline">Detachment from society</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The gaming community has a serious problem with social isolation. This is one of the consequences of video games that receives the most attention. Despite playing multiplayer games, <i>we hardly ever interact with the players</i>. Your mental health might suffer greatly if you spend a lot of time alone. </li>
        </ul>
      <br>

      <li style = "font-size: 25px; text-decoration: underline">Avoiding reality and becoming trapped</li>
      <ul>
        <li style = "padding-bottom: 10px">We all know that playing video games may be a safe haven for people to go to when they don't feel prepared to handle their life's difficulties. But we need to accept the fact that sometimes, things can go wrong. It's a problem if playing video games keeps you from seeking solutions to your problems.</li>
        <li>There is a chance that you are not confronting the issues in your life head-on if you Spend hours a day playing video games. Even though doing so might be quite difficult, it is also one of the best methods to grow. This doesn't mean you necessarily give up playing video games, though.  By regaining control of your life one step at a time, you can keep a healthy balance.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    </ol>
   </p>
  <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px">
    I like to preface that the majority of video games' harmful impacts are a result from <b>overuse</b>. Even the health problems stated only become a concern when a person spends hours playing video games in one place.
  </p>

  <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px">
    Despite the impression that they may cause a lot of issues, many gamers go on to have fulfilling lives while continuing playing video games. Gaming in moderation might be the difference between having fun and letting games take over your life. You can regain control of your life if you can deal with the underlying problems that drive you to play video games for a long time.
