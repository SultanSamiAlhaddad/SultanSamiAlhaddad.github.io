        The majority of students find starting university to be quite intimidating; I know that was the case for me. I think the reason for that was we had no idea what to expect. <u>This is first time we'd be doing things on our own and not have someone hold our hand through our studies like at school</u> and that truely what seperated us from young high school students to adult university students. Usually I would assume that unversity life would just be about finding a job and helping you be prepared for a job life, but university experience helped me realize that it's not just that, <strong>it's also about discovering who you are as a person and the kind of person you want to be</strong>.

        Back at school, <em>I had no idea what path I should take</em>. I knew that should probably further my education through university but, at the time, I didn't know what should I major in. I excelled in most, if not all, subjects so I had a lot to choose from. After heavy debating and looking over my options, <u>I felt a strong connection to Cyber Security</u>. I've always wanted to be in the IT field but wanted it to be relating to protection of data. And with that, I began my life at <abbr title = "British Unvirsity of Bahrain">BUB</abbr> as a Computer Science student majoring in Cyber Security about a year ago. So far, it was quite a journey. The interesting characters I got to meet, the lecturers and the modules they taught, the campus itself and much more.

      <h1 align = "center" style="padding-bottom:10px"> Dealing with Pressure and Stress of deadlines</h1>
      <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-bottom: 15px">
        Where should I even start? I had my fair share of stress coming from high school and into university for a magnitude of reasons but mainly because <u><b>I'm a perfectionist</b></u>. In most situations, I start my work preemptively but would feel stressed out because I would doubt my work and feel as though it wasn't good enough and over-analyse it. Although, the one thing you'd need to learn to adjust to, and constantly get reminded of, is to <u>manage your time effectively</u>! I can't tell you how many times I was told but it's true, one of the causes of stressful university life is poor time management.
      </p>

      <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-bottom: 15px">
        It might be difficult for a university student to understand how to manage their own time. Students typically choose to squander time on pointless activities if they are unable to manage their time effectively in accordance with the demands of university life and the calendar <b>(procrastination)</b>. This is also supported by the fact that <b>school timetables are more structured than university timetables</b>, which are typically more condensed and with that, students may experience stress due to the need to complete a variety of assignments, including those with varying deadlines, lengths, and priorities.

  <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px">
  Peer pressure is the second factor that makes university life hard. There are a lot of people that I know who struggle with this; I was one of them. I found it quite  difficult to make friends when I first enrolled in university, although it was by choice that I didn't have any for a while. <i>Quite weird, isn't it? Avoiding having friends.</i> The reason why is that I had no clue who anybody was.<i> What's their personality like?  What do they enjoy doing on a daily basis?</i> Knowing this helps you avoid hanging out with the wrong person.
  </p>

  <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px">
    Imagine that you are a student who wants to concentrate on their studies and who dislikes to spend time doing unneeded activities. However, you accidentally mixed with a group of individuals who have little regard for their education and who would rather waste time doing unnecessary activities. Stress can be brought on by having to do activities you dislike and maintaining friendships with individuals you find unpleasant. <b>KNOW THE SIGNS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!</b>
  </p>

  <p class = "opening_text" style = "padding: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px"> There is no denying that university life may be stressful for young people, and if they are unable to manage their stress, <em>it can negatively impact their studies and lower their GPA</em>. <u>Making a proper schedule is one technique to relieve stress related to time management</u>. Try to get used to it and forget how you used to manage your time while you were in school and under your parents' care; you are now a young adult. <u>Making friends with the types of people we want to be with can help us cope with peer pressure</u>. Stress can affect both body and mind. As a university student, there is no time for becoming exhausted, ill, or unable to focus or think properly when under a lot of stress. Therefore, stress management is crucial for leading a healthier life. </p>
